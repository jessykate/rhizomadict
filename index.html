    <p>sovereign vocabularies, rhizomatic wordplay, conceptual scaffolding.</p>
    <p>a dictionary project. a concept commons. </p>
    <p>emerging, playful and reimagined terms.</p>
    <p>celebrations of harrowing journeys and ideational ordeals. </p>
    <p>words that we love, that we create, that we think should exist. </p>
    <p>words that we want to call forth from the past. re-belong. unfurl. re-story. extitutionalize. </p>
    <p>a playful way for a community to invite people in, through specialized or esoteric concepts that are still open.</p>
